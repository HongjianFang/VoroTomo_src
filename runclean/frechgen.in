NOTE: On the sixth line, type 1 refers to the first specified velocity field in
vgrids.in (usually P), and type 2 refers to to the second sepcified velocity field
(usually S). However, at this stage, the tomography code can only handle one type of
velocity (i.e. cannot simultaneously invert P and S times yet). Therefore, it is best
to set this to type 1 (and only use 1 for "Velocity types for inversion)

When a subset of velocity or interface derivatives is chosen, then the number to be
entered (>0) must equal the number of layers (interfaces) that are to be inverted.
The indices of the velocity (interface) grids must be equal in number to the number
of layers (interfaces) that are specified. For example, if one chooses:

4                           c: Velocity derivatives (>0=subset, -1=all)

then there should be four entries in the field two lines below, e.g.

2 3 5 6                     c: Indices of velocity grids (if subset chosen)

and four entries in the field two lines below will be:

1 1 1 1                     c: Velocity types for inversion (1 or 2)

In this example, we are inverting for velocity in layers 2,3,5 and 6 (layer 1 is the
top layer). Note that the top and bottom bounding interfaces can be inverted for, but
in most cases, one would probably not want to do this.

Finally, any combination of source locations can be inverted for. If only a subset of
locations are inverted for, then an external file "sourcederivs.in" must be read in.
The two programs for generating synthetic data (moddata) and observed data (obsdata)
will generate these files for you.
